## Brief Description
Algolyzer has the following apps:

### Quiz 
Learn about AI/ML models and test your knowledge by taking interesting quizzes.
- Quizzes are of multiple level ranging from Easy to Veteran. 
- Completing a quiz gains you xp(experience).
- The cumulative experience helps you unlock new models in the playground.

### Playground
Run Machine Learning models and learn from experience.
- Models are run on our server, reducing the need of expensive hardware.
- You supply your own prompt to the model.
- Output is received in the browser after processing.

### Study
Learn about Machine Learning models and how to implement them yourself.
- Study material is divided into modules for each type of model.
- Each module contains comprehensive information about the working of the model.
- The code needed to run the model yourself is included in-line.

### Community
Discuss topics of interest with people all around the world using Algolyzer Community.
- Get help and connect with awesome people using the platform.
- Your submissions are visible to everyone, but your profile is kept private.
- Forums are divided into multiple categories so you can find your niche in a few clicks.
- Posts are editable, so if you need to change anything you can.
